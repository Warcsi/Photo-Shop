# Photo-Shop-
Hello I have created this smallproject to test what I can do and what I cant
a few things are used from online sources
the prefixes are done with AutoPrefixes
The Hero image is from the w3 schools
the jacascript is from a stack overflow and I understand it can be done better with jquerry but I havent learned that yet.

The pictures are all from- pixabay and Istock I dont own any of the photos, this website is just a practice and I dont plan on publishing it.

I made a few mistakes for sure and I know there are quite a few extra un needed css elements,

I dont know how to get the form and the label to allign normally would be very happy if someone told me how to do it. 

Thank you for reading and your feedback.
